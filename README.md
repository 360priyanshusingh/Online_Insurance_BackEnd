"# Developed a robust backend for an online insurance management system, enabling secure and efficient functionalities for admins, employees, agents, and customers, using Node.js and Express.js.

Implemented secure user registration flows for admins, employees, agents, and customers by utilizing hashing algorithms for password storage and RabbitMQ to send email confirmations. Key events like registrations were logged using NLog to ensure traceability.

Designed and optimized database operations, using stored procedures and triggers for critical functionalities such as policy creation, payment processing, premium calculation, and commission computation, ensuring data consistency and adherence to business rules.

Integrated Redis caching for frequently accessed data, such as commission and premium calculations, to improve system performance and reduce database load.

Utilized RabbitMQ as a message broker for real-time notifications, such as informing agents about calculated commissions and policy updates, ensuring seamless inter-service communication.

Enhanced policy lifecycle management by developing backend APIs for policy creation, viewing, cancellation, renewal, and receipt generation. Triggers were used to automatically update policy statuses, and stored procedures ensured the accuracy of business logic.

Streamlined payment processing through backend services that validate and update payment statuses using stored procedures, with detailed logs for all payment activities maintained via NLog for auditing and debugging.

Developed agent and customer dashboards, enabling functionalities like viewing policies, managing commissions, and tracking premiums paid. Built APIs to retrieve relevant data using optimized queries and stored procedures.

Followed MVC architecture for building scalable, organized, and maintainable backend codebases. This ensured clean separation of concerns and allowed for easier future expansions.

Implemented advanced search and filtering functionality, allowing users to find policies or payments by attributes like policy number or customer name. These capabilities were supported by efficient backend logic and database queries.

Focused on reliability and robustness, writing comprehensive test cases with Mocha and Chai to validate API endpoints, ensuring error-free execution of business-critical operations.

Collaborated closely with the frontend and DevOps teams, providing backend support, ensuring smooth integration, and deploying the services seamlessly in the production environment.

Documented all backend functionality and APIs thoroughly, enabling easier onboarding for team members and ensuring clear understanding of service interactions.

Proactively kept up-to-date with backend technologies and best practices, incorporating them into the project to enhance performance, scalability, and security."
